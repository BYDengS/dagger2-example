Dagger2 Example
=====================

This is just a sample Android project which demonstrates the way of integrating [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger "A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.") into your application. 

Additionally, this app also acts as a demo of [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda "Retrolambda lets you run Java 8 code with lambda expressions, method references and try-with-resources statements on Java 7, 6 or 5."), [lombok](http://projectlombok.org/ "Project Lombok makes java a spicier language by adding 'handlers' that know how to build and compile simple, boilerplate-free, not-quite-java code.") and [butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/ "Field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate code for you.") usage in your android apps. Checkout the code to find [lambdas from Java8 and automatic boilerplate code generation](https://github.com/mgrzechocinski/dagger2-example/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/grzechocinski/android/dagger2example/home/HomeActivity.java).
